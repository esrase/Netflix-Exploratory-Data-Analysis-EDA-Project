                                                      Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis Project
Description                                                                                                                                                                                                
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix user data. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights into user behavior and preferences through various data analysis techniques.

Data                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The dataset used in this project is netflix_userbase.csv. It includes information about Netflix users, such as demographics and usage patterns. This data is crucial for understanding user behavior and performing the analysis.

Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                    
The analysis is conducted in the Jupyter notebook eda.ipynb. This notebook includes:
-Data cleaning and preprocessing
-Exploratory data visualization
-Statistical analysis to identify trends and insights

Installation                                                                                                                                                                                                 To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need to have the following Python packages installed:
-pandas                      -matplotlib               -seaborn

Here are some example visualizations from the analysis:
